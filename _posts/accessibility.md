We are committed to providing digital accessibility for people with disabilities and are consistently enhancing the user experience for everyone, implementing the appropriate accessibility measures.

## Measures to Support Accessibility

We aim to make our website as accessible as possible for all users. This includes the ability to:

- Access most of the website using a screen reader.
- Ensure consistent navigation across pages.
- Increase the zoom level up to 500% without text overflowing the display.
- Modify colours, contrast, and styles via browser extensions or settings to suit your needs and preferences.
- Navigate the website using just a keyboard.
- Provide text alternatives for all non-text content.
- Utilise speech recognition software for efficient website navigation.

We have also simplified the websiteâ€™s text for easier comprehension.

## Our Conformance Status

We recognise that some parts of our website are not fully accessible, but we are actively working to improve this. Our goal is to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 AA standard. You may encounter issues such as:

- Images lacking useful alternative text for assistive technology.
- Insufficient contrast ratios for users with colour blindness.
- Missing hidden links for keyboard navigation.
- Non-tagged links that open in new tabs/windows.
- Non-tagged menu dropdowns.
- Titles as text tags not labelled as headings.

## Feedback and contact information

Your feedback is vital in helping us enhance the accessibility of our website. If you encounter any accessibility barriers, please  [contact us](/contact/index.html).
